## Concept Used

The main concept used in this OOPS concept.

### Inheritance

Classes in bricks inherit from the parent class Brick.

### Polymorphism

Functions such as printBrickx() in Brick uses polymorphism.



### Abstraction

Functions such as clear(), checkPaddle(), checkWall() in Ball uses.

### Encapsulation

Classes and objects based approach is used which makes this program more modular and hence encapsulation is used in this.

## Powerups implemented

### Long paddle 
### Short paddle 
### Thru Ball 
### Fast Ball
### Ball grab
